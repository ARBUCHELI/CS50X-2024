. source code ---> This is what humans write.
. machine code ---> This is what computers understand.

	input -> [     ] -> output

	source code -> [ compiler ] -> machine code

. Compiler --> Program that translate one language to another.

. Code can be evaluated upon three axes.
	- Correctness: Does the code run as intended?
	- Design: How well is the code designed?
	- Style: How aesthetically pleasing and consistent is the code?
